      The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle named after the host
      of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal," Monty Hall. In the
      problem, a contestant is presented with three closed doors. Behind one
      door is a valuable prize, while behind the other two doors are less
      desirable prizes. The contestant selects one door, and then the host, who
      knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining two doors to
      reveal a non-prize item. The contestant is then given the option to either
      stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.
      Surprisingly, switching doors offers a higher probability of winning the
      prize, a concept that often challenges intuition and leads to debate about
      probability strategies.
